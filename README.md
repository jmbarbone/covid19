# covid19

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

I almost hate myself for doing another COVID-19 repository. It’s not
necessary and I don’t have specialty in biostatistics or epidemiology.

This repository contains data and some analyses specifically for
Pennsylvania at the county level.

But really, you probably don’t need to use this at all. It’s already
kind of messy. Putting this together is just how I’m coping.

## Installation

You can install the latest version covid19 from [this
repository](https://github.com/jmbarbone/covid19) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jmbarbone/covid19")
```
